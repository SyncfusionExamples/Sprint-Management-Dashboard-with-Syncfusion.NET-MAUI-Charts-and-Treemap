# Build a Sprint Management Dashboard with Syncfusion® .NET MAUI Charts and Treemap

Visualize agile sprint progress, task distribution, and scope changes using Syncfusion’s .NET MAUI Charts and Treemap.

## Overview

The Sprint Management Dashboard provides agile teams with a clear, interactive view of sprint health. Built with MVVM architecture, KPI cards, and Syncfusion® .NET MAUI chart controls, this sample demonstrates how to transform sprint data into actionable insights for developers, team leads, and stakeholders.

## Key Features

- **Sprint Summary Cards:** Quick-glance KPIs for worked hours, completed tasks, and story points
- **Task Status Breakdown**: Pie chart showing task distribution across statuses (Closed, In Progress, On Hold)
- **Task Type Analysis:** Bar chart comparing planned vs. completed tasks across categories (Bug, Feature, Documentation, etc.)
- **Scope Change Tracking:** Grouped column chart visualizing planned, added, and removed tasks across sprints
- **Priority-Based Incomplete Tasks:** Treemap highlighting pending tasks segmented by project and priority

## Usage Scenarios

The dashboard adapts naturally to agile workflows, offering clarity for sprint planning and retrospectives.

### Sprint Tracking

- Monitor worked hours, completed tasks, and story points with KPI cards
- Spot bottlenecks with task status distribution

### Task Analysis

- Compare planned vs. completed tasks by type to identify delivery gaps
- Track scope creep with added/removed tasks across sprints

### Priority Mapping

- Visualize incomplete tasks by project and urgency using Treemap nodes
- Identify high-priority pending work for better sprint planning

## Technologies Used

- **.NET MAUI:** Cross-platform UI framework
- **Syncfusion .NET MAUI Toolkit:** Advanced charting and treemap controls
- **C# & XAML:** Implementation languages
- **MVVM Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with ViewModels and model classes
